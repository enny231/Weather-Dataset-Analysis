<h1> Weather-Dataset-Analysis </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves analyzing weather classification data to extract meaningful insights. The dataset includes various weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, UV index, season, visibility, location, and weather type. The goal is to understand the patterns and relationships within the data and to predict weather types based on these features.

Dataset Description Temperature : Degrees Celsius Humidity : Percentage Wind Speed : km/h Precipitation (%) : Probability of precipitation Cloud Cover : Description (e.g., partly cloudy, clear, overcast) Atmospheric Pressure : hPa UV Index : UV radiation level Season : Season of the year Visibility (km) : Visibility distance Location : Geographical type (e.g., inland, mountain, coastal) Weather Type : Categorized as Rainy, Cloudy, Sunny, etc.




<h2>Analysis and Insights

Summary Statistics and Distribution Analysis Objective: Calculate summary statistics and visualize distributions.
Key Findings: Temperature: Moderate range, significant variability. Humidity: Generally high. Wind Speed: Moderate variability, some extremes. Precipitation: High probabilities common. Atmospheric Pressure: Mostly stable. UV Index: Generally moderate, occasional highs. Visibility: Mostly good, some low visibility instances.

Correlation Analysis Objective: Identify relationships between numerical features.
Key Findings: Temperature and Humidity: Negative correlation. Temperature and UV Index: Positive correlation. Humidity and Precipitation: Positive correlation. Wind Speed and Visibility: Positive correlation.

Weather Type Distribution Analysis Objective: Analyze distribution of Weather Types across Seasons and Locations.
Key Findings: Seasonal: Rainy weather common in Winter/Spring, Sunny in Spring/Summer. Location: Rainy in inland/mountain areas, Sunny in coastal regions.

Temperature Trends Objective: Analyze temperature trends across Seasons and Locations.
Key Findings: Seasonal Trends: Lower in Winter, higher in Summer. Location Trends: High variability inland, stable in coastal areas.

Humidity and Precipitation Analysis Objective: Explore relationship between Humidity and Precipitation.
Key Findings: Higher humidity leads to higher precipitation probability.

UV Index Analysis Objective: Analyze UV Index variations with Seasons and Cloud Cover.
Key Findings: Higher UV Index in Spring/Summer, lower in Winter/Fall. Clear skies have higher UV Index.

Visibility and Atmospheric Pressure Analysis Objective: Examine relationship between Visibility and Atmospheric Pressure.
Key Findings: Higher atmospheric pressure correlates with better visibility.

Wind Speed Patterns Objective: Identify patterns in Wind Speed across Weather Types and Locations.
Key Findings: Lower wind speeds in sunny weather, higher in cloudy/rainy. Higher variability inland, higher speeds in coastal areas.
